### Refined Mechanics for Trading Support in Ethical Dilemmas

1. **Explicit Agreement Terms**:
   - When players agree to support each other in future Ethical Dilemmas, they must specify the terms. For example, "I'll support your decision in the next two Ethical Dilemmas," or "I'll back your choice in any Dilemma involving AI Bias."

2. **Trade Tokens or Markers**:
   - Use special tokens or markers to represent the agreement. When a player receives support as per the agreement, they hand over the token to the supporting player. This visual representation helps track commitments and ensures transparency.

3. **Limitation on Number of Agreements**:
   - Players can only have a limited number of active support agreements at any time to prevent over-reliance on this mechanic. For example, a player may only be part of two active support agreements simultaneously.

4. **Consequences for Breaking Agreements**:
   - If a player breaks an agreement (e.g., not supporting as promised), they face a penalty, such as losing Ethical Points or other resources. This adds a layer of risk to breaking agreements.

5. **One-Time Use per Dilemma**:
   - Support can only be used once per Ethical Dilemma. This prevents the over-centralization of decision power in a single player's hands.

6. **Ethical Dilemma Card Types**:
   - Some Ethical Dilemma cards might be marked as "Critical" or "High Impact," where support agreements cannot be applied. This ensures that certain key decisions remain individual responsibilities.

7. **Announcement of Support**:
   - When an Ethical Dilemma occurs, players must publicly announce if they are using a support agreement. This keeps all players informed and adds an element of strategy in how and when to utilize support.

8. **Strategic Revocation Option**:
   - Players have the option to revoke a support agreement at a cost, such as paying resources to the other party. This introduces strategic flexibility but at a price.
