### AI Model Cards

1. **Basic AI Model - "Neural Network Prototype"**
   - Balance Check: Steady gain of 2 Data Points per turn seems fair for a basic model. Ensure it's a viable choice even when more advanced models are available.
   - Simulation Note: Check if players are incentivized to upgrade to advanced models or if they tend to stick with basic models for too long.

2. **Advanced AI Model - "Self-Optimizing Algorithm"**
   - Balance Check: This model's ability to trade Data Points for CP could be powerful. Ensure the trade-off is balanced and does not devalue the CP resource.
   - Simulation Note: Observe how often players opt for this trade and its impact on overall resource management.

3. **Experimental AI Model - "Quantum AI Entity"**
   - Balance Check: High risk and reward should be clearly defined. Perhaps introduce a mechanic where there's a chance of model failure, resulting in loss of resources or Data Points.
   - Simulation Note: Ensure that the risk involved does not deter players from attempting to build this model, while keeping its powerful effects in check.
