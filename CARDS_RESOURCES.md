### Resource Cards

1. **Computational Power (CP) Card - "Quantum Computing Cluster"**
   - Balance Check: +3 CP is a significant boost. Ensure it's balanced by making this card somewhat rare. 
   - Simulation Note: Observe if this card overly accelerates AI model development in early game.

2. **Energy Card - "Solar Energy Harvest"**
   - Balance Check: +2 Energy every turn is a steady benefit. Consider the card's frequency in the deck to prevent energy saturation.
   - Simulation Note: Monitor if this leads to excessive energy accumulation, making energy management less strategic.

3. **Capital Card - "Venture Capital Investment"**
   - Balance Check: A one-time +5 Capital can be powerful. Its impact should be offset by its rarity or by introducing cards that can counteract sudden capital influxes.
   - Simulation Note: Assess if players using this card gain an unfair advantage in purchasing power.
