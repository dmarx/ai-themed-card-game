different research labs and startups could be factions or be associated with factions, e.g. deepmind., openai, stability, laion, eleuther, coreweave, etc.

maybe the faction mechanic could be used to encourage collaboration between members of a common faction

faction membership could assign a faction-specific game-end condition. e.g. maybe the e/acc faction can force game end by bringing about AGI, or doomers can force game end by playing/publishing K "ai regulations" or ... whatever

oooo here's an idea. there could be two factions, and in any game players will be assigned to one or the other. the overarching goal is for *your faction* to win. so e.g. e/acc vs. doomers, e/acc wins by building AGI, doomers win by publishing enough regulations that AGI becomes impossible
