### Ethical Dilemma Enhancement Ideas

1. **Ethical Dilemma Board**:
   - A separate board or tracker that visualizes the collective impact of players' choices on ethical dilemmas. It could track the overall ethical 'health' of the game world, influenced by players' decisions.

2. **Ethical Impact Tokens**:
   - Tokens that players earn or lose based on their choices in Ethical Dilemmas. These could influence the end-game scoring or unlock certain abilities.

3. **Collaborative Dilemma Resolutions**:
   - Mechanisms for players to collaboratively resolve larger ethical dilemmas, potentially affecting all players and requiring a consensus or majority vote.

4. **Dynamic Dilemma Outcomes**:
   - Cards or a digital app that provides random or evolving outcomes of Ethical Dilemmas based on current game state, adding unpredictability and depth.

5. **Ethical Advisor Role**:
   - A rotating role where one player acts as an 'Ethical Advisor' each round, offering a bonus or penalty to players based on their Ethical Dilemma decisions. This role could add an extra layer of player interaction.
