### Resource Management Section

**Original Text**: "Players collect CP, Energy, and Capital at the beginning of their turn. These resources are used for building AI Models, influencing decisions, and resolving ethical dilemmas."

**Revised Text**: 
"Each turn, players automatically generate 2 CP, 2 Energy, and 1 Capital, simulating ongoing AI research and development. Players can also play Resource Cards for additional gains. To ensure dynamic gameplay, each player can hold a maximum of 10 CP, 10 Energy, and 5 Capital at any time. Excess resources are 'invested' back into the community, and players receive 1 Influence Point for every 5 excess resources."

### AI Model Development Section

**Original Text**: "AI Models require resources to build. Each model type has different benefits and contributes to your data points."

**Revised Text**: 
"AI Models are the cornerstone of your AI empire. Basic Models require 3 CP and 2 Energy, Advanced Models need 5 CP and 4 Energy, while Experimental Models demand 7 CP and 6 Energy. Upgrading from Basic to Advanced costs 2 CP and 2 Energy, and from Advanced to Experimental costs 3 CP and 2 Energy. Each upgrade grants additional Data Points and special abilities, like 'Data Mining' for Basic Models, which gives 1 extra DP each turn."

### Influence Mechanics Section

**Original Text**: "Influence Points are gained through special actions and can sway the game's direction."

**Revised Text**: 
"Influence represents your sway in the AI community. Gain Influence Points by playing Influencer Cards or making significant advancements in AI. Spend Influence Points to resolve Ethical Dilemmas in your favor or to activate special abilities of Influencer Cards. Note that high-impact influence actions, such as 'Corporate Espionage,' now cost 3 Influence Points, reflecting their powerful effect on gameplay."

### Ethical Dilemmas Section

**Original Text**: "Ethical Dilemmas present tough choices, impacting your ethical score and game progress."

**Revised Text**: 
"Ethical Dilemmas challenge your moral compass and strategic foresight. These dilemmas must be resolved within two turns of drawing or face a penalty of losing 2 DP and 1 IP. Dilemmas can be resolved using Influence Points, specific AI Models, or by sacrificing resources. For example, resolving 'Data Privacy Breach' may require 3 CP or 2 Influence Points. Ignoring ethical considerations can be risky but sometimes necessary for strategic advancement."

### Example Scenarios and Playthroughs

- **Addition**: Include a new section with example scenarios and a sample playthrough demonstrating key strategies and decision points, such as resolving a complex Ethical Dilemma or managing resources effectively during a critical phase of the game.

### Design and Layout Improvements

- **Visual Aids**: Add flowcharts for the AI Model development process and resolving Ethical Dilemmas.
- **Quick Reference Guide**: Compile a one-page summary of essential rules, including resource caps, AI Model requirements, and influence actions.
