# Structured High Level Notes

## Resources

* Captial
* Compute
* Data
  * raw -> refined
  * types by modality: text, image, other
* influence
  * reputation (h-index, ethical points)
  * reach (followers)

Capital can be used to purchase compute, data, and influence (just reach, not reputation).

Compute and data are required inputs for crafting "models".

Models consume compute and produce capital and data. "shipping" a model increases influence (definitely reputation... reach too)

## Models

Models have the following attributes
* data types and quantities: some amount of data of whichever modalities required to train the model
* training compute cost: paying down the compute cost for training a model should take several turns. when the compute cost is paid down, the model has been "trained"
* inference compute cost: a model can only be used to produce resources if the user has committed compute to the model, and the amount of output the model generates is proportional to the committed compute.
* open source or not: once an open model is trained, any user can commit compute to it to generate resources. closed models can still be used by other players, but they have to pay capital to whoever owns the compute that is "serving" the model
