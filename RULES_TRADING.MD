## 7. Special Mechanisms

### A. Trade and Negotiation

1. **Resource Trading**:
   - During the Resource Trading Phase, players can exchange CP, Energy, and Capital among themselves. 
   - Trades can include combinations of different resources. For example, a player can trade 5 CP for 3 Energy with another player.
   - All trades are binding once agreed upon.

2. **Card Effect Trading**:
   - Certain cards are designated as 'tradable'. Their effects can be traded with other players instead of being used.
   - For example, a player can trade the effect of a "Quantum Computing Boost" card to another player in exchange for resources or other card effects.
   - Once a card effect is traded, it is marked as 'used' and cannot be traded again during the same turn.

3. **Future Turn Promises**:
   - Players can negotiate actions to be taken in future turns as part of trade deals.
   - Examples include promises not to play certain cards against the trader in the next turn or to assist in resolving an upcoming Ethical Dilemma.
   - If a player breaks a promise, they incur penalties such as losing Influence Points or Ethical Points.

4. **Ethical Decision Influencing**:
   - When resolving Ethical Dilemma Cards, players can negotiate with others to influence their decisions in exchange for resources or other benefits.
   - This mechanism allows players to impact decisions that might not directly involve them, adding a layer of strategic depth and player interaction.

- Conditional trades based on future events are allowed.

**Trade Limitations and Conditional Trades**
- Limit of three trades per turn, per player.
- Conditional trades must be clear and agreed upon by all involved parties.

**Resource Loaning**
- Players can loan resources, expecting them back with interest in future turns.

**Special Trading Cards**
- Certain cards can enhance or restrict trading abilities.
- Example: "Market Manipulator" allows a player to alter resource values for one turn.

**Visibility and Ethical Considerations**
- All trades are announced publicly.

### Trading Scenario Cards Content

---

1. **High-Stakes Trade**
   - Scenario: You need CP to build an AI Model, but another player wants your Influence Card. Do you trade?
   - Considerations: Will the AI Model benefit outweigh the loss of the Influence Card?

2. **Strategic Loan**
   - Scenario: A player offers you resources but asks for double in return later. Do you accept the loan?
   - Considerations: Can you afford to repay the loan without hindering your progress?

3. **Conditional Alliance**
   - Scenario: An opponent proposes to trade resources now in exchange for your support in future Ethical Dilemmas.
   - Considerations: Is aligning with this player beneficial for your long-term strategy?

### Refined Mechanics for Trading Support in Ethical Dilemmas

1. **Explicit Agreement Terms**:
   - When players agree to support each other in future Ethical Dilemmas, they must specify the terms. For example, "I'll support your decision in the next two Ethical Dilemmas," or "I'll back your choice in any Dilemma involving AI Bias."

2. **Trade Tokens or Markers**:
   - Use special tokens or markers to represent the agreement. When a player receives support as per the agreement, they hand over the token to the supporting player. This visual representation helps track commitments and ensures transparency.

3. **Limitation on Number of Agreements**:
   - Players can only have a limited number of active support agreements at any time to prevent over-reliance on this mechanic. For example, a player may only be part of two active support agreements simultaneously.

4. **Consequences for Breaking Agreements**:
   - If a player breaks an agreement (e.g., not supporting as promised), they face a penalty, such as losing Ethical Points or other resources. This adds a layer of risk to breaking agreements.

5. **One-Time Use per Dilemma**:
   - Support can only be used once per Ethical Dilemma. This prevents the over-centralization of decision power in a single player's hands.

6. **Ethical Dilemma Card Types**:
   - Some Ethical Dilemma cards might be marked as "Critical" or "High Impact," where support agreements cannot be applied. This ensures that certain key decisions remain individual responsibilities.

7. **Announcement of Support**:
   - When an Ethical Dilemma occurs, players must publicly announce if they are using a support agreement. This keeps all players informed and adds an element of strategy in how and when to utilize support.

8. **Strategic Revocation Option**:
   - Players have the option to revoke a support agreement at a cost, such as paying resources to the other party. This introduces strategic flexibility but at a price.
