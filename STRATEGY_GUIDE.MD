### Beginner Strategy Guide for "AI Assembly"

**Welcome to AI Assembly!** As a new player, diving into the world of AI development and strategic gameplay can be exhilarating. This guide provides foundational strategies and card combination ideas to help you navigate your first few games.

#### Understanding the Basics
- **Resource Management**: Early in the game, focus on building a balanced pool of Computational Power (CP), Energy, and Capital. This will allow flexibility in AI development and influence actions.
- **AI Model Development**: Start with building Basic AI Models. They are less resource-intensive and provide a steady increase in Data Points (DP).
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Approach Ethical Dilemmas with a strategy in mind. Sometimes it’s worth sacrificing Ethical Points (ES) for immediate gains in DP or Influence Points (IP).


#### Understanding the Basics (ALT)

1. **Resource Management**: Initially, focus on building a balanced resource base (CP, Energy, and Capital). Efficient resource management is key to developing AI Models and using Influence Cards effectively.

2. **AI Model Development**: Start by building Basic AI Models. They are less resource-intensive and provide a steady flow of Data Points (DP), which are crucial for victory.

3. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Approach Ethical Dilemmas with a strategy in mind. Sometimes, it's worth sacrificing a few Ethical Points for a greater advantage elsewhere.

4. **Influence Cards Use**: Use Influence Cards strategically. They can provide significant advantages or disrupt opponents' plans.
